NFFTs

Non-Fungible Fiat Tokens

nfft.dev

NFFTs are datas that are minted on the Ethereum blockchain. These datas consist of the digital image and serial number data of actual fiat currency minted onto a blockchain using Ethereum smart contracts.

Each dollars image, serial number and value is saved as a SVG block of data and triple hashed with 256-SHA algorithm.

Banks already have bill counter scanners. 

We develop the software that saves that data as blockchain entry attributes using an Ethereum smart contract.
